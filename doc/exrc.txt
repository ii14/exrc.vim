*exrc.txt*					A secure exrc reimplementation

==============================================================================
INTRODUCTION					*exrc-introduction*

*exrc.vim* is a secure reimplementation of 'exrc' feature.

Enables the reading of local config files in the current working directory.

The advantage over the native 'exrc' feature is that each file has to be
manually marked as trusted, before it can be sourced. *exrc.vim* keeps track
of file hashes and every time the content or location of a config file
changes, it has to be marked as trusted again.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
COMMAND						*exrc-command*

:ExrcTrust {file}				*:ExrcTrust*
	Add {file} to trusted files.
	If {file} is not specified, the current buffer is selected.

	To automatically mark saved files as trusted, use this autocmd:
>
		autocmd BufWritePost .exrc ExrcTrust
<
:ExrcEdit					*:ExrcEdit*
	Edit local config file.

:ExrcSource					*:ExrcSource*
	Source local config file.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
OPTIONS						*exrc-options*

g:exrc#names					*g:exrc#names*
	List of accepted filenames.

	If the list includes filenames that are used by the native 'exrc'
	option (".vimrc", ".exrc" or ".gvimrc"), the 'exrc' option has to be
	turned off.
>
		set noexrc
<
	Default: [".exrc.local", ".vimrc.local"]

g:exrc#hash_func				*g:exrc#hash_func*
	Hashing function.

	The default function uses builtin |sha256()| function. If vim is
	compiled without |+cryptv| option, a custom function can be provided.
	Function should take a filename as an argument and return a |String|.
	Returned value is stripped from whitespace and only first word is
	used as a hash.
>
		fun! HashFile(fname)
			return system('sha512sum '.shellescape(a:fname))
		endfun
		let g:exrc#hash_func = 'HashFile'
<
g:exrc#cache_file				*g:exrc#cache_file*
	Path to the cache file with trusted hashes.

	Default: "$HOME/.exrc_cache" or "|stdpath('cache')|/.exrc_cache"
